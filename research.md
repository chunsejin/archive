My research combines artificial intelligence, the semantic web, and (stream-)database integration techniques to solve complex, fast-changing information integration problems. I leverage general research techniques across information-intensive disciplines, including smart energy, data integration and the social Web.

I am pursuing an approach to blend Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning(**AI/ML**) with the stream processing. My work focuses on solving real-world problems to bridge research and relevant applications, such as integrating and linking scholarly data, analyzing social media data, and the integration of industrial information. 

My research area has included promising studies of:

* Theory for stream reasoning 
> Theoretical investigation that surpasses Complex Event Processing(CEP), Data Stream Management(DSMS)  
> Notion of soundness and completeness for stream reasoning

* Logic language for stream reasoning
> Investigation about semantics of logic languages such as Description Logic, Metric Temporal Logic, and other logics 
  
* Stream data management for the semantic web
> Define cost metrics, 
> Parallel processing of multiple queries 

* Stream reasoning engineering
> Optimization, and evaluation of stream reasoners  
> Real-time stream reasoning and approximate stream reasoning

* Stream reasoning applications
> Internet-of-Things(IoT), Smart-grid/Micro-grid, Scholarly knowledge graph, and etc

As always, I am interested in fundamental research area of:

* Knowledge representation and distribution
* Knowledge graph modelling
* Semantic Web
