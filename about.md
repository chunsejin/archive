I’m Sejin Chun as computer scientist. From March 2020, I am going to join an assistant professor in the Department of computer engineer at [Dong-A University](https://computer.donga.ac.kr/sites/computer/index.do). Before joining the department, I worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology([NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)) in the USA from 2018 to 2020 as a guest researcher.

My primary research is reasoning over knowledge graphs. Reasoning can either deduct necessary knowledge with given conclusions([deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)) or induce possible conclusions from some evidence([inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning)).
I am interested in an approach to combining both reasoning techniques in order to infer new conclusions from existing data.
