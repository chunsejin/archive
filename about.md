Sejin Chun is a computer scientist with a background in the theoretical knowledge reasoning, logic, as well as stream data management. He is an an assistant professor in the department of computer engineer at [Dong-A University](https://computer.donga.ac.kr/sites/computer/index.do). He received his PhD degree in computer science from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea. Before joining the department, I worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology([NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)) in the USA from 2018 to 2020 as a guest researcher. 

My primary research is to study a [logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning) over [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph). By using the logical reasoning, we can discover potential relationships among entities in the knowledge graph. Specifically, it can either deduct necessary knowledge with given conclusions([deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)) or induce possible conclusions from some evidence([inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning)).
