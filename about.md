Sejin Chun is a computer scientist with a background in the theoretical knowledge reasoning, logic, as well as stream data management. He is an an assistant professor in the department of computer engineer at [Dong-A University](https://computer.donga.ac.kr/sites/computer/index.do). He received his PhD degree in computer science from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea. Before joining the department, I worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology([NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)) in the USA from 2018 to 2020 as a guest researcher. 

My primary research is to study a [logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning) over [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph). A knowledge graph is a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities as a knowledge base, where a graph-based data model enables users to effectively. search for people, places, and things. In the knowledge graph, the logical reasoning helps discover potential relationships among entities. In particular, it can either deduct necessary knowledge with given conclusions([deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)) or induce possible conclusions from some evidence([inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning)).
I am interested in an approach to combining both reasoning techniques in order to infer new conclusions from existing data.
